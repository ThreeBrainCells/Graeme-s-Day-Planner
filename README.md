# Graeme-s-Day-Planner
This is an attempt at getting my life in order and demonstrate my knowledge of Bootstrap, JQuery etc. This website has sections for each hour, and a space where a user can assign tasks to each hour.

I used a bunch of inputs copied from the Bootstrap library to represent hours from 9 to 5. I used Moment.js to check whether each hour is the current hour, and changed their color depending on the result. 

When an input's save button is pressed, whatever was put into the input field is saved to local storage, so the input's placeholder text is replaced upon load.

This is the result:https://threebraincells.github.io/Graeme-s-Day-Planner/
